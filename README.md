# Cryptography
Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. In this Project, the user can encode or decode any information. The encoded value would be decoded once the correct encoded code is entered.
